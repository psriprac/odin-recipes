        <h2>This crab omelette recipe makes for a decadent weekend eggs dish that's perfect if you're just back from an early morning shop at the fish markets, armed with luxurious fresh crab meat. This crab omelette is a little sweet, a little spicy, and very, very moreish.</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>80 grams cup fresh cooked crabmeat blue swimmer if possible</li>
            <li>1 long red chilli halved, seeds removed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of neutral oil</li>
            <li>4 spring onions thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup snow pea sprouts</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 small bunch coriander</li>
            <li>Sriracha sauce to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Deseed the chilli and finely chop half the chilli and add to a hot pan with a little oil and the white ends of the spring onions and the ginger.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until the spring onions and the ginger are translucent and add to the crab meat in a small bowl and stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lightly beat the eggs until yolks are broken and mix in the soy and fish sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare your garnish. Thinly slice the remaining chilli into strips. Pick a small handful of coriander leaves. Wash and drain the snow pea sprouts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Over medium-high heat add the rest of the oil and the butter to an omelette pan. When it's hot add the egg mixture and leave it for 15 seconds to start to set a little. With a silicon spatula, begin pushing the cooked egg towards the centre of the pan and additionally swirl the pan to get the unset eggs to cook. Run the spatula around the rim of the pan to stop it from sticking.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the omelette is becoming firm and there is only a little liquid on the surface of the omelette add the crab mixture to the centre of the omelette. Using the spatula, fold one side of the omelette to just over centre of the pan, followed by the other side. This will be the bottom of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take the pan off the heat and turn the omelette over onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're going to present this to guests and want a fancy presentation, slice the omelette in half.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle with the oyster sauce and Sriracha, followed by the snow pea sprouts, the chilli strips and the coriander.
            </li>
        </ol>
