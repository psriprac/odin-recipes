        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of kosher salt, getting rid of any loose skin. Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity with the ginger slices and scallions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch (2 cm), and season with salt to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the pot from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes to stop the cooking process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and green onion.
            </li>
            <li>
                After it's cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the chicken from drying out.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large wok or skillet, heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved chopped chicken fat, the garlic, ginger, and salt, and fry until aromatic, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reserve 1/4 of the fried garlic mixture, then add the rice to the remaining fried garlic and stir to coat. Cook for 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add 2 cups (480 ml) of reserved poaching broth. Steam the rice for 60 minutes, or until tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the rice is cooking, carve the chicken for serving.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the chili sauce: combine the sambal, Sriracha, sugar, garlic, ginger, lime juice, and chicken broth in a small bowl and stir to incorporate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the ginger garlic sauce: in a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, salt, peanut oil, and rice vinegar, and stir to incorporate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the soy sauce: in a small bowl, combine the reserved fried garlic and ginger with the oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and chicken broth, and stir to incorporate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the sliced chicken with the rice, dipping sauces, sliced cucumbers, and fresh cilantro.
            </li>
